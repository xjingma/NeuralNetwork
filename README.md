# NeuralNetwork
Assignment projects of Coursra course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Andrew Ng
The projects are written by python. The files include:
1. LogisticRegression_NN.py: build a logistic regression classfier 
2. planarDataClassification.py: generate red and blue points to form a flower, fit a neural network to correctly classify the points
3. buildDNN.py: Build a deep neural network
4. DNN_ImageClassfication.py: apply a deep neural network to supervised learning
